# TexCreate-Migration
The Current Status of TexCreate's Migration from MKProjects

- [ ] `texcgen`
- [ ] `texcreate`
- [ ] `texcweb`
- [ ] `mkproj_texcgen`
- [ ] `texcreate_repo`
- [ ] `texcore`
- [ ] `texcreate_v3_compiler_conf`
- [ ] `texc_v3_web`

We will also be publishing TexCreate v3.2.1 patch to permanently have it be on offline mode, and 
will set v3 repo from `mkproj_texcgen` as the latest. Our focus will not be towards `v3` but will be on 
the development on the next major version `v4`.
